# Connecting to HUZZAH32

This following work is a **group work**! Make sure to have all your group assembled before starting it. It is important that all of the members of your group understand how to work with the HUZZAH32 board. That is because your group will be split to go to the labs. One of the biggest challenges previous years for almost all groups was that some members missed key basic operation procedure and couldn't proceed with the lab work and data retrieval. 
> :warning: It is your group responsibility to ensure that you are all up to speed. In the case of extreme misunderstanding regarding this, you can always talk to your TAs and the teacher.
